(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(** In the [Logic] chapter, we looked at several ways of writing
    propositions, including conjunction, disjunction, and quantifiers.
    In this chapter, we bring a new tool into the mix: _inductive
    definitions_. *)

(** Recall that we have seen two ways of stating that a number [n] is
    even: We can say (1) [evenb n = true], or (2) [exists k, n =
    double k].  Yet another possibility is to say that [n] is even if
    we can establish its evenness from the following rules:

       - Rule [ev_0]:  The number [0] is even.
       - Rule [ev_SS]: If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even. *)

(** To illustrate how this definition of evenness works, let's
    imagine using it to show that [4] is even. By rule [ev_SS], it
    suffices to show that [2] is even. This, in turn, is again
    guaranteed by rule [ev_SS], as long as we can show that [0] is
    even. But this last fact follows directly from the [ev_0] rule. *)

(** We will see many definitions like this one during the rest
    of the course.  For purposes of informal discussions, it is
    helpful to have a lightweight notation that makes them easy to
    read and write.  _Inference rules_ are one such notation: *)
(**

                              ------------                        (ev_0)
                                 ev 0

                                  ev n
                             --------------                      (ev_SS)
                              ev (S (S n))
*)

(** Each of the textual rules above is reformatted here as an
    inference rule; the intended reading is that, if the _premises_
    above the line all hold, then the _conclusion_ below the line
    follows.  For example, the rule [ev_SS] says that, if [n]
    satisfies [ev], then [S (S n)] also does.  If a rule has no
    premises above the line, then its conclusion holds
    unconditionally.

    We can represent a proof using these rules by combining rule
    applications into a _proof tree_. Here's how we might transcribe
    the above proof that [4] is even: *)
(**

                             ------  (ev_0)
                              ev 0
                             ------ (ev_SS)
                              ev 2
                             ------ (ev_SS)
                              ev 4
*)

(** Why call this a "tree" (rather than a "stack", for example)?
    Because, in general, inference rules can have multiple premises.
    We will see examples of this below. *)

(** Putting all of this together, we can translate the definition of
    evenness into a formal Coq definition using an [Inductive]
    declaration, where each constructor corresponds to an inference
    rule: *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
| ev_0 : ev 0
| ev_SS : forall n : nat, ev n -> ev (S (S n)).

(** This definition is different in one crucial respect from
    previous uses of [Inductive]: its result is not a [Type], but
    rather a function from [nat] to [Prop] -- that is, a property of
    numbers.  Note that we've already seen other inductive definitions
    that result in functions, such as [list], whose type is [Type ->
    Type].  What is new here is that, because the [nat] argument of
    [ev] appears _unnamed_, to the _right_ of the colon, it is allowed
    to take different values in the types of different constructors:
    [0] in the type of [ev_0] and [S (S n)] in the type of [ev_SS].

    In contrast, the definition of [list] names the [X] parameter
    _globally_, to the _left_ of the colon, forcing the result of
    [nil] and [cons] to be the same ([list X]).  Had we tried to bring
    [nat] to the left in defining [ev], we would have seen an error: *)

Fail Inductive wrong_ev (n : nat) : Prop :=
| wrong_ev_0 : wrong_ev 0
| wrong_ev_SS : forall n, wrong_ev n -> wrong_ev (S (S n)).
(* ===> Error: A parameter of an inductive type n is not
        allowed to be used as a bound variable in the type
        of its constructor. *)

(** ("Parameter" here is Coq jargon for an argument on the left of the
    colon in an [Inductive] definition; "index" is used to refer to
    arguments on the right of the colon.) *)

(** We can think of the definition of [ev] as defining a Coq property
    [ev : nat -> Prop], together with primitive theorems [ev_0 : ev 0] and
    [ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n))]. *)

(** Such "constructor theorems" have the same status as proven
    theorems.  In particular, we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the
    rule names to prove [ev] for particular numbers... *)

Theorem ev_4 : ev 4.
Proof. apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0. Qed.

(** ... or we can use function application syntax: *)

Theorem ev_4' : ev 4.
Proof. apply (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)). Qed.

(** We can also prove theorems that have hypotheses involving [ev]. *)

Theorem ev_plus4 : forall n, ev n -> ev (4 + n).
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. intros Hn.
  apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply Hn.
Qed.

(** More generally, we can show that any number multiplied by 2 is even: *)

(** * Using Evidence in Proofs *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are even, we can also
    _reason about_ such evidence.

    Introducing [ev] with an [Inductive] declaration tells Coq not
    only that the constructors [ev_0] and [ev_SS] are valid ways to
    build evidence that some number is even, but also that these two
    constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that numbers
    are even (in the sense of [ev]). *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [ev n], then we know that [E] must have one of two shapes:

      - [E] is [ev_0] (and [n] is [O]), or
      - [E] is [ev_SS n' E'] (and [n] is [S (S n')], where [E'] is
        evidence for [ev n']). *)

(** This suggests that it should be possible to analyze a hypothesis
    of the form [ev n] much as we do inductively defined data
    structures; in particular, it should be possible to argue by
    _induction_ and _case analysis_ on such evidence.  Let's look at a
    few examples to see what this means in practice. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion on Evidence *)

(** Suppose we are proving some fact involving a number [n], and we
    are given [ev n] as a hypothesis.  We already know how to perform
    case analysis on [n] using the [inversion] tactic, generating
    separate subgoals for the case where [n = O] and the case where [n
    = S n'] for some [n'].  But for some proofs we may instead want to
    analyze the evidence that [ev n] _directly_.

    By the definition of [ev], there are two cases to consider:

    - If the evidence is of the form [ev_0], we know that [n = 0].

    - Otherwise, the evidence must have the form [ev_SS n' E'], where
      [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is evidence for [ev n']. *)

(** We can perform this kind of reasoning in Coq, again using
    the [inversion] tactic.  Besides allowing us to reason about
    equalities involving constructors, [inversion] provides a
    case-analysis principle for inductively defined propositions.
    When used in this way, its syntax is similar to [destruct]: We
    pass it a list of identifiers separated by [|] characters to name
    the arguments to each of the possible constructors.  *)

Theorem ev_minus2 : forall n,
  ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *) simpl. apply ev_0.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl. apply E'.  Qed.

(** In words, here is how the inversion reasoning works in this proof:

    - If the evidence is of the form [ev_0], we know that [n = 0].
      Therefore, it suffices to show that [ev (pred (pred 0))] holds.
      By the definition of [pred], this is equivalent to showing that
      [ev 0] holds, which directly follows from [ev_0].

    - Otherwise, the evidence must have the form [ev_SS n' E'], where
      [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is evidence for [ev n'].  We must then
      show that [ev (pred (pred (S (S n'))))] holds, which, after
      simplification, follows directly from [E']. *)

(** This particular proof also works if we replace [inversion] by
    [destruct]: *)

Theorem ev_minus2' : forall n,
  ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *) simpl. apply ev_0.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl. apply E'.  Qed.

(** The difference between the two forms is that [inversion] is more
    convenient when used on a hypothesis that consists of an inductive
    property applied to a complex expression (as opposed to a single
    variable).  Here's is a concrete example.  Suppose that we wanted
    to prove the following variation of [ev_minus2]: *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.

(** Intuitively, we know that evidence for the hypothesis cannot
    consist just of the [ev_0] constructor, since [O] and [S] are
    different constructors of the type [nat]; hence, [ev_SS] is the
    only case that applies.  Unfortunately, [destruct] is not smart
    enough to realize this, and it still generates two subgoals.  Even
    worse, in doing so, it keeps the final goal unchanged, failing to
    provide any useful information for completing the proof.  *)

Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0. *)
    (* We must prove that [n] is even from no assumptions! *)
Abort.

(** What happened, exactly?  Calling [destruct] has the effect of
    replacing all occurrences of the property argument by the values
    that correspond to each constructor.  This is enough in the case
    of [ev_minus2'] because that argument, [n], is mentioned directly
    in the final goal. However, it doesn't help in the case of
    [evSS_ev] since the term that gets replaced ([S (S n)]) is not
    mentioned anywhere. *)

(** The [inversion] tactic, on the other hand, can detect (1) that the
    first case does not apply, and (2) that the [n'] that appears on
    the [ev_SS] case must be the same as [n].  This allows us to
    complete the proof: *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E'].
  (* We are in the [E = ev_SS n' E'] case now. *)
  apply E'.
Qed.

(** By using [inversion], we can also apply the principle of explosion
    to "obviously contradictory" hypotheses involving inductive
    properties. For example: *)

Theorem one_not_even : ~ ev 1.
Proof.
  intros H. inversion H. Qed.

(** Prove the following result using [inversion]. *)

Theorem even5_nonsense :
  ev 5 -> 2 + 2 = 9.
Proof.
  (* 请在此处解答 *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** The way we've used [inversion] here may seem a bit
    mysterious at first.  Until now, we've only used [inversion] on
    equality propositions, to utilize injectivity of constructors or
    to discriminate between different constructors.  But we see here
    that [inversion] can also be applied to analyzing evidence for
    inductively defined propositions.

    Here's how [inversion] works in general.  Suppose the name [I]
    refers to an assumption [P] in the current context, where [P] has
    been defined by an [Inductive] declaration.  Then, for each of the
    constructors of [P], [inversion I] generates a subgoal in which
    [I] has been replaced by the exact, specific conditions under
    which this constructor could have been used to prove [P].  Some of
    these subgoals will be self-contradictory; [inversion] throws
    these away.  The ones that are left represent the cases that must
    be proved to establish the original goal.  For those, [inversion]
    adds all equations into the proof context that must hold of the
    arguments given to [P] (e.g., [S (S n') = n] in the proof of
    [evSS_ev]). *)

(** The [ev_double] exercise above shows that our new notion of
    evenness is implied by the two earlier ones (since, by
    [even_bool_prop] in chapter [Logic], we already know that
    those are equivalent to each other). To show that all three
    coincide, we just need the following lemma: *)

Lemma ev_even_firsttry : forall n,
  ev n -> exists k, n = double k.
Proof.
(* 课上已完成 *)

(** We could try to proceed by case analysis or induction on [n].  But
    since [ev] is mentioned in a premise, this strategy would probably
    lead to a dead end, as in the previous section.  Thus, it seems
    better to first try inversion on the evidence for [ev].  Indeed,
    the first case can be solved trivially. *)

  intros n E. inversion E as [| n' E'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl.

(** Unfortunately, the second case is harder.  We need to show [exists
    k, S (S n') = double k], but the only available assumption is
    [E'], which states that [ev n'] holds.  Since this isn't directly
    useful, it seems that we are stuck and that performing case
    analysis on [E] was a waste of time.

    If we look more closely at our second goal, however, we can see
    that something interesting happened: By performing case analysis
    on [E], we were able to reduce the original result to an similar
    one that involves a _different_ piece of evidence for [ev]: [E'].
    More formally, we can finish our proof by showing that

        exists k', n' = double k',

    which is the same as the original statement, but with [n'] instead
    of [n].  Indeed, it is not difficult to convince Coq that this
    intermediate result suffices. *)

    assert (I : (exists k', n' = double k') ->
                (exists k, S (S n') = double k)).
    { intros [k' Hk']. rewrite Hk'. exists (S k'). reflexivity. }
    apply I. (* reduce the original goal to the new one *)

Admitted.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Evidence *)

(** If this looks familiar, it is no coincidence: We've encountered
    similar problems in the [Induction] chapter, when trying to use
    case analysis to prove results that required induction.  And once
    again the solution is... induction!

    The behavior of [induction] on evidence is the same as its
    behavior on data: It causes Coq to generate one subgoal for each
    constructor that could have used to build that evidence, while
    providing an induction hypotheses for each recursive occurrence of
    the property in question. *)

(** Let's try our current lemma again: *)

Lemma ev_even : forall n,
  ev n -> exists k, n = double k.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  induction E as [|n' E' IH].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E'
       with IH : exists k', n' = double k' *)
    destruct IH as [k' Hk'].
    rewrite Hk'. exists (S k'). reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Here, we can see that Coq produced an [IH] that corresponds to
    [E'], the single recursive occurrence of [ev] in its own
    definition.  Since [E'] mentions [n'], the induction hypothesis
    talks about [n'], as opposed to [n] or some other number. *)

(** The equivalence between the second and third definitions of
    evenness now follows. *)

Theorem ev_even_iff : forall n,
  ev n <-> exists k, n = double k.
Proof.
  intros n. split.
  - (* -> *) apply ev_even.
  - (* <- *) intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply ev_double.
Qed.

(** As we will see in later chapters, induction on evidence is a
    recurring technique across many areas, and in particular when
    formalizing the semantics of programming languages, where many
    properties of interest are defined inductively. *)

(** The following exercises provide simple examples of this
    technique, to help you familiarize yourself with it. *)

(** * Inductive Relations *)

(** A proposition parameterized by a number (such as [ev])
    can be thought of as a _property_ -- i.e., it defines
    a subset of [nat], namely those numbers for which the proposition
    is provable.  In the same way, a two-argument proposition can be
    thought of as a _relation_ -- i.e., it defines a set of pairs for
    which the proposition is provable. *)

Module Playground.

(** One useful example is the "less than or equal to" relation on
    numbers. *)

(** The following definition should be fairly intuitive.  It
    says that there are two ways to give evidence that one number is
    less than or equal to another: either observe that they are the
    same number, or give evidence that the first is less than or equal
    to the predecessor of the second. *)

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
  | le_n : forall n, le n n
  | le_S : forall n m, (le n m) -> (le n (S m)).

Notation "m <= n" := (le m n).

(** Proofs of facts about [<=] using the constructors [le_n] and
    [le_S] follow the same patterns as proofs about properties, like
    [ev] above. We can [apply] the constructors to prove [<=]
    goals (e.g., to show that [3<=3] or [3<=6]), and we can use
    tactics like [inversion] to extract information from [<=]
    hypotheses in the context (e.g., to prove that [(2 <= 1) ->
    2+2=5].) *)

(** Here are some sanity checks on the definition.  (Notice that,
    although these are the same kind of simple "unit tests" as we gave
    for the testing functions we wrote in the first few lectures, we
    must construct their proofs explicitly -- [simpl] and
    [reflexivity] don't do the job, because the proofs aren't just a
    matter of simplifying computations.) *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (subsequence)  *)
(** A list is a _subsequence_ of another list if all of the elements

      [1;2;3]

    is a subsequence of each of the lists

(** * Case Study: Regular Expressions *)

(** The [ev] property provides a simple example for illustrating
    inductive definitions and the basic techniques for reasoning about
    them, but it is not terribly exciting -- after all, it is
    equivalent to the two non-inductive definitions of evenness that
    we had already seen, and does not seem to offer any concrete
    benefit over them.  To give a better sense of the power of
    inductive definitions, we now show how to use them to model a
    classic concept in computer science: _regular expressions_. *)

(** Regular expressions are a simple language for describing strings,
    defined as follows: *)

Inductive reg_exp {T : Type} : Type :=
| EmptySet : reg_exp
| EmptyStr : reg_exp
| Char : T -> reg_exp
| App : reg_exp -> reg_exp -> reg_exp
| Union : reg_exp -> reg_exp -> reg_exp
| Star : reg_exp -> reg_exp.

(** Note that this definition is _polymorphic_: Regular
    expressions in [reg_exp T] describe strings with characters drawn
    from [T] -- that is, lists of elements of [T].

    (We depart slightly from standard practice in that we do not
    require the type [T] to be finite.  This results in a somewhat
    different theory of regular expressions, but the difference is not
    significant for our purposes.) *)

(** We connect regular expressions and strings via the following
    rules, which define when a regular expression _matches_ some
    string:

      - The expression [EmptySet] does not match any string.

      - The expression [EmptyStr] matches the empty string [[]].

      - The expression [Char x] matches the one-character string [[x]].

      - If [re1] matches [s1], and [re2] matches [s2], then [App re1
        re2] matches [s1 ++ s2].

      - If at least one of [re1] and [re2] matches [s], then [Union re1
        re2] matches [s].

      - Finally, if we can write some string [s] as the concatenation of
        a sequence of strings [s = s_1 ++ ... ++ s_k], and the
        expression [re] matches each one of the strings [s_i], then
        [Star re] matches [s].

        As a special case, the sequence of strings may be empty, so
        [Star re] always matches the empty string [[]] no matter what
        [re] is. *)

(** We can easily translate this informal definition into an
    [Inductive] one as follows: *)

Inductive exp_match {T} : list T -> reg_exp -> Prop :=
| MEmpty : exp_match [] EmptyStr
| MChar : forall x, exp_match [x] (Char x)
| MApp : forall s1 re1 s2 re2,
           exp_match s1 re1 ->
           exp_match s2 re2 ->
           exp_match (s1 ++ s2) (App re1 re2)
| MUnionL : forall s1 re1 re2,
              exp_match s1 re1 ->
              exp_match s1 (Union re1 re2)
| MUnionR : forall re1 s2 re2,
              exp_match s2 re2 ->
              exp_match s2 (Union re1 re2)
| MStar0 : forall re, exp_match [] (Star re)
| MStarApp : forall s1 s2 re,
               exp_match s1 re ->
               exp_match s2 (Star re) ->
               exp_match (s1 ++ s2) (Star re).

(** Again, for readability, we can also display this definition using
    inference-rule notation.  At the same time, let's introduce a more
    readable infix notation. *)

Notation "s =~ re" := (exp_match s re) (at level 80).

*)

(** Notice that these rules are not _quite_ the same as the informal
    ones that we gave at the beginning of the section.  First, we
    don't need to include a rule explicitly stating that no string
    matches [EmptySet]; we just don't happen to include any rule that
    would have the effect of some string matching [EmptySet].  (Indeed,
    the syntax of inductive definitions doesn't even _allow_ us to
    give such a "negative rule.")

    Second, the informal rules for [Union] and [Star] correspond
    to two constructors each: [MUnionL] / [MUnionR], and [MStar0] /
    [MStarApp].  The result is logically equivalent to the original
    rules but more convenient to use in Coq, since the recursive
    occurrences of [exp_match] are given as direct arguments to the
    constructors, making it easier to perform induction on evidence.
    (The [exp_match_ex1] and [exp_match_ex2] exercises below ask you
    to prove that the constructors given in the inductive declaration
    and the ones that would arise from a more literal transcription of
    the informal rules are indeed equivalent.)

    Let's illustrate these rules with a few examples. *)

Example reg_exp_ex1 : [1] =~ Char 1.
Proof.
  apply MChar.
Qed.

Example reg_exp_ex2 : [1; 2] =~ App (Char 1) (Char 2).
Proof.
  apply (MApp [1] _ [2]).
  - apply MChar.
  - apply MChar.
Qed.

(** (Notice how the last example applies [MApp] to the strings [[1]]
    and [[2]] directly.  Since the goal mentions [[1; 2]] instead of
    [[1] ++ [2]], Coq wouldn't be able to figure out how to split the
    string on its own.)

    Using [inversion], we can also show that certain strings do _not_
    match a regular expression: *)

Example reg_exp_ex3 : ~ ([1; 2] =~ Char 1).
Proof.
  intros H. inversion H.
Qed.

(** We can define helper functions for writing down regular
    expressions. The [reg_exp_of_list] function constructs a regular
    expression that matches exactly the list that it receives as an
    argument: *)

Fixpoint reg_exp_of_list {T} (l : list T) :=
  match l with
  | [] => EmptyStr
  | x :: l' => App (Char x) (reg_exp_of_list l')
  end.

Example reg_exp_ex4 : [1; 2; 3] =~ reg_exp_of_list [1; 2; 3].
Proof.
  simpl. apply (MApp [1]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [2]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [3]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply MEmpty.
Qed.

(** We can also prove general facts about [exp_match].  For instance,
    the following lemma shows that every string [s] that matches [re]
    also matches [Star re]. *)

Lemma MStar1 :
  forall T s (re : @reg_exp T) ,
    s =~ re ->
    s =~ Star re.

  intros T s re H.
  rewrite <- (app_nil_r _ s).
  apply (MStarApp s [] re).
  - apply H.
  - apply MStar0.

    exactly the same shape expected by [MStarApp].) *)

(** Since the definition of [exp_match] has a recursive
    structure, we might expect that proofs involving regular
    expressions will often require induction on evidence. *)


(** For example, suppose that we wanted to prove the following
    intuitive result: If a regular expression [re] matches some string
    [s], then all elements of [s] must occur as character literals
    somewhere in [re].

    To state this theorem, we first define a function [re_chars] that
    lists all characters that occur in a regular expression: *)

Fixpoint re_chars {T} (re : reg_exp) : list T :=
  match re with
  | EmptySet => []
  | EmptyStr => []

  | App re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Union re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Star re => re_chars re
  end.

(** We can then phrase our theorem as follows: *)

Theorem in_re_match : forall T (s : list T) (re : reg_exp) (x : T),
  s =~ re ->
  In x s ->
  In x (re_chars re).
Proof.

    _two_ induction hypotheses: One that applies when [x] occurs in
    [s1] (which matches [re]), and a second one that applies when [x]
    occurs in [s2] (which matches [Star re]).  This is a good
    illustration of why we need induction on evidence for [exp_match],
    as opposed to [re]: The latter would only provide an induction
    hypothesis for strings that match [re], which would not allow us
    to reason about the case [In x s2]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** One potentially confusing feature of the [induction] tactic is
    that it happily lets you try to set up an induction over a term
    that isn't sufficiently general.  The effect of this is to lose
    information (much as [destruct] can do), and leave you unable to
    complete the proof.  Here's an example: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : @reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s1 s2 re H1.

(** Just doing an [inversion] on [H1] won't get us very far in
    the recursive cases. (Try it!). So we need induction (on
    evidence!). Here is a naive first attempt: *)

  induction H1
    as [|x'|s1 re1 s2' re2 Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2
        |s1 re1 re2 Hmatch IH|re1 s2' re2 Hmatch IH
        |re''|s1 s2' re'' Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2].

(** But now, although we get seven cases (as we would expect from the
    definition of [exp_match]), we have lost a very important bit of
    information from [H1]: the fact that [s1] matched something of the
    form [Star re].  This means that we have to give proofs for _all_
    seven constructors of this definition, even though all but two of
    them ([MStar0] and [MStarApp]) are contradictory.  We can still
    get the proof to go through for a few constructors, such as
    [MEmpty]... *)

  - (* MEmpty *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H.

(** ... but most cases get stuck.  For [MChar], for instance, we
    must show that

    s2 =~ Char x' -> x' :: s2 =~ Char x',

    which is clearly impossible. *)

  - (* MChar. Stuck... *)
Abort.

(** The problem is that [induction] over a Prop hypothesis only works
    properly with hypotheses that are completely general, i.e., ones
    in which all the arguments are variables, as opposed to more
    complex expressions, such as [Star re].

    (In this respect, [induction] on evidence behaves more like
    [destruct] than like [inversion].)

    We can solve this problem by generalizing over the problematic
    expressions with an explicit equality: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re re' : reg_exp),
  re' = Star re ->
  s1 =~ re' ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** We can now proceed by performing induction over evidence directly,
    because the argument to the first hypothesis is sufficiently
    general, which means that we can discharge most cases by inverting
    the [re' = Star re] equality in the context.

    This idiom is so common that Coq provides a tactic to
    automatically generate such equations for us, avoiding thus the
    need for changing the statements of our theorems. *)

Abort.

(** Invoking the tactic [remember e as x] causes Coq to (1) replace
    all occurrences of the expression [e] by the variable [x], and (2)
    add an equation [x = e] to the context.  Here's how we can use it
    to show the above result: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (pumping)  *)
(** One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of
    regular expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which
    states, informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching
    a regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re].

    To begin, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we are
    working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able to
    calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

Module Pumping.

Fixpoint pumping_constant {T} (re : @reg_exp T) : nat :=
  match re with
  | EmptySet => 0
  | EmptyStr => 1
  | Char _ => 2
  | App re1 re2 =>
      pumping_constant re1 + pumping_constant re2
  | Union re1 re2 =>
      pumping_constant re1 + pumping_constant re2
  | Star _ => 1
  end.

(** Next, it is useful to define an auxiliary function that repeats a
    string (appends it to itself) some number of times. *)

Fixpoint napp {T} (n : nat) (l : list T) : list T :=
  match n with
  | 0 => []
  | S n' => l ++ napp n' l

Lemma napp_plus: forall T (n m : nat) (l : list T),

Proof.
  intros T n m l.
  induction n as [|n IHn].
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IHn, app_assoc. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Now, the pumping lemma itself says that, if [s =~ re] and if the
    length of [s] is at least the pumping constant of [re], then [s]
    can be split into three substrings [s1 ++ s2 ++ s3] in such a way
    that [s2] can be repeated any number of times and the result, when
    combined with [s1] and [s3] will still match [re].  Since [s2] is
    also guaranteed not to be the empty string, this gives us
    a (constructive!) way to generate strings matching [re] that are
    as long as we like. *)

Lemma pumping : forall T (re : @reg_exp T) s,

  exists s1 s2 s3,
    s = s1 ++ s2 ++ s3 /\
    s2 <> [] /\
    forall m, s1 ++ napp m s2 ++ s3 =~ re.

(** To streamline the proof (which you are to fill in), the [omega]
    tactic, which is enabled by the following [Require], is helpful in
    several places for automatically completing tedious low-level
    arguments involving equalities or inequalities over natural
    numbers.  We'll return to [omega] in a later chapter, but feel

    theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (beq_nat n) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].

      left. reflexivity.
    + (* beq_nat n m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly apply
    the [beq_nat_true_iff] lemma to the equation generated by
    destructing [beq_nat n m], to convert the assumption [beq_nat n m
    = true] into the assumption [n = m]; then we had to [rewrite]
    using this assumption to complete the case. *)

(** We can streamline this by defining an inductive proposition that
    yields a better case-analysis principle for [beq_nat n m].
    Instead of generating an equation such as [beq_nat n m = true],
    which is generally not directly useful, this principle gives us
    right away the assumption we really need: [n = m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
| ReflectT : P -> reflect P true
| ReflectF : ~ P -> reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  Intuitively, it states that the property
    [P] is _reflected_ in (i.e., equivalent to) the boolean [b]: that
    is, [P] holds if and only if [b = true].  To see this, notice
    that, by definition, the only way we can produce evidence that
    [reflect P true] holds is by showing that [P] is true and using
    the [ReflectT] constructor.  If we invert this statement, this
    means that it should be possible to extract evidence for [P] from
    a proof of [reflect P true].  Conversely, the only way to show
    [reflect P false] is by combining evidence for [~ P] with the
    [ReflectF] constructor.

    It is easy to formalize this intuition and show that the two
    statements are indeed equivalent: *)

(** The advantage of [reflect] over the normal "if and only if"
    connective is that, by destructing a hypothesis or lemma of the

    the same time generating appropriate hypothesis in the two
    branches ([P] in the first subgoal and [~ P] in the second). *)

(** In this small example, this technique gives us only a rather small

    examples in later chapters and in _Programming Language
    Foundations_.

    The use of the [reflect] property was popularized by _SSReflect_,
    a Coq library that has been used to formalize important results in
    mathematics, including as the 4-color theorem and the
    Feit-Thompson theorem.  The name SSReflect stands for _small-scale
    reflection_, i.e., the pervasive use of reflection to simplify
    small proof steps with boolean computations. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge)  *)
(** Let's prove that our definition of [filter] from the [Poly]
    chapter matches an abstract specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

    is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

    and

    [4;3].

    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    Translate this specification into a Coq theorem and prove
    it.  (You'll need to begin by defining what it means for one list
    to be a merge of two others.  Do this with an inductive relation,
    not a [Fixpoint].)  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Extended Exercise: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match autmatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implemement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represeneted
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Export Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there
    are a few key lemmas that are left for you to prove. *)

    property of [derive] that you'll need to use in all proofs of
    properties of the matcher is [derive_corr]. *)


(** A function [m] matches regexes if, given string [s] and regex [re],
    it evaluates to a value that reflects whether [s] is matched by
    [re]. I.e., [m] holds the following property: *)

  forall (s : string) re, reflect (s =~ re) (m s re).

(** Finally, prove that [regex_match] in fact matches regexes.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [match_eps] to
    regex [re], then a natural proof applies [match_eps_refl] to [re]
    and destructs the result to generate cases in which you may assume
    that [re] does or does not match the empty string.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [derive] to
    character [x] and regex [re], then a natural proof applies
    [derive_corr] to [x] and [re] to prove that [x :: s =~ re] given
    [s =~ derive x re], and vice versa. *)
